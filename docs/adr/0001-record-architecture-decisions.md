# 0001 — Record architecture decisions

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD <!-- set when you adopt the template -->

## Context

This project will be built and maintained largely by LLM agents across many
sessions. Decisions and their rationale must be discoverable by an agent (or
a future maintainer) with no conversational context.

## Decision

Record every significant architecture decision as a numbered ADR in
`docs/adr/`, using this format: Status, Date, Context, Decision, Consequences,
Alternatives considered. ADRs are immutable once accepted; a reversal is a new
ADR that marks the old one `Superseded by NNNN`.

## Consequences

- Agents can be pointed at `docs/adr/` to learn why things are the way they
  are before proposing changes.
- Slight writing overhead per decision; worth it for a project whose premise
  is agent-maintainability.

## Alternatives considered

- **Decisions in commit messages or chat history:** not discoverable at the
  moment of need; agents propose relitigating settled questions. Rejected.
- **A single living DECISIONS.md:** edits erase the record of what was
  believed when; immutability is the point. Rejected.
