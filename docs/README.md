# Documentation

Docs are split by the question they answer:

| Directory | Question | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [adr/](adr/) | **Why** did we choose this? | Architecture Decision Records — immutable once accepted; superseded, never edited |
| [design/](design/) | **How** does it fit together? | Living documents describing the current architecture |
| [specs/](specs/) | **What exactly** is the contract? | Precise, testable interface definitions |
| [plans/](plans/) | **When/in what order** do we build? | Roadmaps and phase plans; updated as work lands |

## Index

## Conventions

- **New docs start from their category's `TEMPLATE.md`** (in each directory).
- New decision → new ADR with the next number; if it reverses an old one, mark
  the old one `Superseded by NNNN` rather than editing it.
- Design docs are updated in place to always reflect reality.
- Specs change only alongside the code that implements them.
- Cross-links between categories are mandatory in both directions — see the
  documentation rules in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md are
  symlinks to it, ADR-0002).
- Adding a doc means adding it to the index above.
